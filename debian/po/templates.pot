"This version of OpenSSH has a considerably changed configuration file from "
"the version shipped in Debian 'Potato', which you appear to be upgrading "
"from. This package can now generate a new configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd."
"config), which will work with the new server version, but will not contain "
"any customizations you made with the old version."

msgid ""
"Please note that this new configuration file will set the value of "
"'PermitRootLogin' to 'yes' (meaning that anyone knowing the root password "
"can ssh directly in as root). Please read the README.Debian file for more "
"details about this design choice."

msgid ""
"The currently installed version of /etc/init.d/ssh is likely to kill all "
"running sshd instances. If you are doing this upgrade via an SSH session, "
"you're likely to be disconnected and leave the upgrade procedure unfinished."

"This can be fixed by manually adding \"--pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid\" to the "

msgid ""
"The current host key, in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key, is encrypted with the IDEA "

msgid ""
"Password authentication appears to be disabled in the current OpenSSH server "
"configuration. In order to prevent users from logging in using passwords "
"(perhaps using only public key authentication instead) with recent versions "
"of OpenSSH, you must disable challenge-response authentication, or else "
"ensure that your PAM configuration does not allow Unix password file "
"authentication."

#. Type: boolean

"If you disable challenge-response authentication, then users will not be "
"able to log in using passwords. If you leave it enabled (the default "
"answer), then the 'PasswordAuthentication no' option will have no useful "
"effect unless you also adjust your PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d/ssh."
