Template: ssh/new_config
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Generate a new configuration file for OpenSSH?
 This version of OpenSSH has a considerably changed configuration file from
 the version shipped in Debian 'Potato', which you appear to be upgrading
 from. This package can now generate a new configuration file
 (/etc/ssh/sshd.config), which will work with the new server version, but
 will not contain any customizations you made with the old version.
 .
 Please note that this new configuration file will set the value of
 'PermitRootLogin' to 'yes' (meaning that anyone knowing the root password
 can ssh directly in as root). Please read the README.Debian file for
 more details about this design choice.
 .
 It is strongly recommended that you choose to generate a new
 configuration file now.

Template: ssh/use_old_init_script
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want to risk killing active SSH sessions?
 The currently installed version of /etc/init.d/ssh is likely to kill
 all running sshd instances. If you are doing this upgrade via an SSH
 session, you're likely to be disconnected and leave the upgrade
 procedure unfinished.
 .
 This can be fixed by manually adding "--pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid" to
 the start-stop-daemon line in the stop section of the file.

Template: ssh/encrypted_host_key_but_no_keygen
Type: note
_Description: New host key mandatory
 The current host key, in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key, is encrypted with the
 IDEA algorithm. OpenSSH can not handle this host key file, and the
 ssh-keygen utility from the old (non-free) SSH installation does not
 appear to be available.
 .
 You need to manually generate a new host key.

Template: ssh/disable_cr_auth
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Disable challenge-response authentication?
 Password authentication appears to be disabled in the current OpenSSH
 server configuration. In order to prevent users from logging in using
 passwords (perhaps using only public key authentication instead) with
 recent versions of OpenSSH, you must disable challenge-response
 authentication, or else ensure that your PAM configuration does not allow
 Unix password file authentication.
 .
 If you disable challenge-response authentication, then users will not be
 able to log in using passwords. If you leave it enabled (the default
 answer), then the 'PasswordAuthentication no' option will have no useful
 effect unless you also adjust your PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d/ssh.
