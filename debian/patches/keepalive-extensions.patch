Subject: Various keepalive extensions

Add compatibility aliases for ProtocolKeepAlives and SetupTimeOut, supported
in previous versions of Debian's OpenSSH package but since superseded by
ServerAliveInterval.  (We're probably stuck with this bit for
compatibility.)

In batch mode, default ServerAliveInterval to five minutes.

Adjust documentation to match and to give some more advice on use of
keepalives.
